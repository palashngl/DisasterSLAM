# DisasterSLAM: Collaborative Multimodal Intelligence for Uncertainty-Aware Disaster Mapping and Human-Guided Navigation

This is a minimal project page for the CVPR first submission (under review). It is designed to be anonymous and **easy to upload** to GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `disasterslam-cvpr`).
2. Upload the files in this folder to the root of your repo.
3. Put your submission PDF at `assets/paper.pdf`.
4. Put your video at `assets/demo.mp4` (or use a YouTube/Vimeo embed in `index.html`).
5. In your repo settings → **Pages**, set:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`) / **Root** (`/`)
6. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Anonymity checklist
- Keep authors/affiliations hidden until camera-ready.
- Remove metadata from the PDF and media files.
- Avoid linking to profiles or institutional sites.

## Customize
- Edit text in `index.html`.
- Swap colors or spacing in `style.css`.
- Replace the placeholder BibTeX after acceptance.
